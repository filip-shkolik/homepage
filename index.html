                  <h2>Résumé</h2>
                  <p>&mdash; I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been
                    more successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful
                    like me. Romney &mdash; I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and haters,
                    but my IQ is one of the highest &mdash; and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or
                    insecure, it's not your fault.</p>

                EXPERIENCE
                2017
                Became 45th president of the United States

                2016
                Won election race with 77 votes more than Clinton, yippe-kee-yay!

                2015
                Became the most important Republican nominating for presidential election run

                2009
                Changed my mind and became Republican again

                2005
                Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny: no grades, certificates and other
                bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth
                creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos
                filed lawsuits against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                2002
                Acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue.
                I
                sure do like my surname!

                2001
                Completed Trump World Tower and joined the Democratic Party

                1999
                Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them now in USA and abroad! Also switched
                to the Reform Party that year

                1997
                Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which was named Trump Place. Me and the other
                investors sold our shares for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest residential sale in the history
                of New York City

                1996
                Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall
                Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building

                1994
                Refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle, turned it into a 44-story luxury property
                known as Trump International Hotel and Tower

                1989 ― 1992
                Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of money, I had to sell it, now it is
                American Airlines Shuttle, btw

                1989, 1990
                Learned about Tour de France and decided to hold my very own Tour de Trump. Is America not great enough
                for that cycling competition?

                1988
                Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested $50 million to restore the building and
                boosted it from three-star to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a lot of cash
                in 1995)

                1987
                Registered as a Republican

                1985
                I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a private club.You can join if you pay
                $200K initiation fee (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich).
                That
                year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another
                Trump!

                1983
                I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I changed team's play schedule and filed an
                antitrust lawsuit against United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now, but back then
                they were great!

                1980
                Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed a crew of undocumented Polish
                workers
                to demolish the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                architectural
                critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space
                to
                be completed in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a repair job on the Wollman
                Rink
                in Central Park and completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less than
                the
                initial budget!

                1978
                Purchased a 50 percent stake in the derelict Commodore Hotel and turned it into the Grand Hyatt Hotel in
                2
                years of remodeling

                1971
                Was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization

                1968
                Began my career at my father's real estate development company, Elizabeth Trump & Son

                PERSONAL LIFE
                2006
                Melania gained United States citizenship and gave birth to our son, Barron

                2005
                Married her

                1998
                Met my future third wife, Melania Knauss

                1999
                Divorced Marla ¯_(ツ)_/¯

                1993
                Married Marla and had a daughter, we named her Tiffany, because I like Tiffany & Company jewellery as
                well

                1992
                Started affair with Marla Maples, so I had to divorce. God knows I love nice women, I love them all!
